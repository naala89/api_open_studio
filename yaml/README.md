Running calls with test YAML documents
======================================

If you don't want to import a YAML doc into the DB while developing, you can run straight from the /yaml/test dir.

1. Change private member Api->test to a string of the YAML you want to test with.
2. perform the query as you would with the resource defined in the YAML.
